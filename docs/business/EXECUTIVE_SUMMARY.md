## Problem Statement

### Current Enterprise Challenges

#### 1. Fragmented AI Model Access

**Problem**: Enterprises must manage multiple vendor relationships, APIs, and billing systems.

- **DALL-E 3**: Requires OpenAI account, limited controls
- **Stable Diffusion**: Self-hosting complexity, GPU costs
- **Adobe Firefly**: Enterprise agreement required
- **Midjourney**: No enterprise API, Discord-based interface

**Impact**:
- IT teams spend 20+ hours/month managing vendor integrations
- No unified budgeting or cost allocation
- Security teams struggle to audit usage across platforms

#### 2. Compliance and Governance Gaps

**Problem**: Existing AI image tools lack enterprise governance features.

**Missing Capabilities**:
- ❌ ISO 27001 compliance
- ❌ Immutable audit trails
- ❌ PII detection and redaction
- ❌ Content moderation and filtering
- ❌ Department-level budget controls
- ❌ RBAC with granular permissions

**Impact**:
- 73% of enterprises have banned or restricted AI tools due to compliance concerns
- Average cost of data breach: $4.45M globally, $3.8M in Australia
- Regulatory risk in financial services, healthcare, government sectors

#### 3. Cost Unpredictability

**Problem**: AI image generation costs can spiral without controls.

**Scenarios**:
- Marketing team generates 1,000 images at $0.08 each = $80
- Multiply across 10 departments = $800/day = $24K/month
- No visibility until the invoice arrives

**Impact**:
- Budget overruns of 200-400% reported by early AI adopters
- Finance teams lack real-time cost tracking
- No chargeback mechanisms for department budgeting

#### 4. Data Sovereignty Concerns

**Problem**: Many AI services process data in US or European regions.

**Australian Requirements**:
- Privacy Act 1988 mandates data protection
- APRA CPS 234 requires data residency for financial institutions
- Government contracts often prohibit offshore data processing

**Impact**:
- 58% of Australian enterprises cite data sovereignty as a blocker to AI adoption
- Inability to serve government and regulated sectors
